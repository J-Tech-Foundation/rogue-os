ROGUE OS
===

___

rogue os is an open source operating system similar to the way linux is free to duplicate, edit, and distribute, but better! with configurations that are limitless,

a soon to be famous company pushing it onward to victory, and a very nice discord community of developers helping us with our EXE file writing from scratch to form the 

basics of this beautiful project.
